USING AARDVARK TO BUILD A SIMPLE PROJECT:

The testproject/ directory contains a simple Java project with a meaningful build.vark buildfile.  Within that directory, you can run "vark -p" to see the targets available.  Let's say you want to compile the testproject code and its tests, and then run the tests.  The "test" target will do this.
    vark test


BUILDING AARDVARK FROM SOURCE:

Yes, we build Aardvark with Maven. Run "mvn package" from the command line.
